[Matricula Online](https://data.matricula-online.eu/) is a website that hosts
parish registers from various regions across Europe. This CLI tool allows you to
fetch data from it and save the data to a file.

---

Our GitHub Workflow automatically scrapes a list with all parishes once a week
and pushes to
[`cache/parishes`](https://github.com/lsg551/matricula-online-scraper/tree/cache/parishes).

Note that this tool will not format or clean the data in any way. Instead, the
data is saved as-is to a file. I mention this because the original data is
especially poorly formatted and contains a lot of inconsistencies. It is up to
the user to process the data further.

## 🔧 Installation

Make sure to have a recent version of Python installed. You can then install
this script via `pip`:

```console
$ pip install --user matricula-online-scraper
```

Nevertheless, you can clone this repository and run the script with
[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org).

## 💡 How To Use

```console
$ matricula-online-scraper --help
```

prints available commands and options, including documentation. Same goes for
each subcommand, e.g. `matricula-online-scraper fetch --help`.

The `fetch` command is the primary command to fetch any resources from Matricula
Online. Its subcommands allow you to scrape different resources, run
`matricula-online-scraper fetch --help` to see available subcommands.

### Example 1:

Fetch all available locations and save them to a `.jsonl` file:

```console
$ matricula-online-scraper fetch locations ./output.jsonl
```

> :warning: This will fetch all parishes from Matricula Online, which may take a
> few minutes. Despite that, this data only changes rarely, but frequent
> scraping will put unnecessary load on the server. Therefore our GitHub
> Workflow caches this data once a week and pushes to
> [`cache/parishes`](https://github.com/lsg551/matricula-online-scraper/tree/cache/parishes).

### Example 2:
